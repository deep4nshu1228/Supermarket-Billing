# Supermarket-Billing-System
- I designed and developed a robust Supermarket Billing System using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to streamline and automate the billing process.
- Utilized OOP concepts such as classes and inheritance to organize and encapsulate code, resulting in a modular and maintainable codebase.
- This project demonstrates proficiency in C++, OOP, software design, and problem-solving abilities.
